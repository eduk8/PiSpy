# PiSpy
This is a Python 3 Raspberry Pi Project with PifaceCAD and Raspberry Pi Camera to create a headless photography device.

This program allows the user to:
Take still photos
Take video
Make timelapse videos from a number of stills
Make slow motion videos
shutdown the raspberry pi

Please feel free to take and edit the code to suit your own needs.
